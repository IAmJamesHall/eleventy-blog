# Motivations
I've got to find some purpose in life. I've got to find something that gets me up in the morning. I've got to find something to live for. 

Currently I don't have any of those. And so, my resulting actions are aimless & futile. I do things that I feel I shouldn't because I don't have an overarching purpose to constrain me.

I don't know what I want to be in life. But I don't just mean a career. Ultimately, I don't think my career is very important. What's more important is how I approach that career.

So if I end up as a Walmart associate for the rest of my life, I think I'd be fine with that, as long as I knew what my purpose was, and as long as I lived by that purpose. 

I've got to find that purpose soon. I don't want to spend any more time in this aimlessness.
