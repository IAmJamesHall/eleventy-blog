# Motivations

I've started several little blogs in the past. Most haven't gotten more than a dozen posts. But maybe that's because I set too high of expectations for them.

One time, I tried posting once a day. That's a good way to generate a ton of half-baked content. But then after a month I forgot about it, and now that website is gone.

This time, inspired by [Manuel Moreale's website](https://manuelmoreale.com) which I just rediscovered, I'm going to try to post once or twice a month. And I'm going to try to keep the things I say thoughtful & helpful.
